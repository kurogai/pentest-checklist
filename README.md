Do you know that moment when you are doing pentest and want to imagine what kind of vulnerability you can find at that point? And that moment when you think <strong>"what flaws can I exploit at this point? And what attack vectors would result?"</strong>

Well, in this list you can find a series of things to be tested during the pentest, it helps if you need to think about multiple ways to find vulnerabilities on a website, this list uses the latest model of the OWASP Top 10 of 2017 completely detailed .

Feel free to contribute to this repository, even if it really helps you, share it with someone :).

# OWASP Top 10 - 2017

### 1 - Injection

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

#### 1.1 For SQLi

#### Test cases

* Are user data in common fields validated? (login, reset password, search button, object references, Data that will be stored in a database)
* Does the application check file names if it supports upload? (It is possible to have sqli with the name of a file when they are not filtered correctly)
* If the application has a rest API, are the parameters vulnerable?
* If it is a blind sqli (where errors do not usually appear and it only perceives it as true or false), is it possible to obtain data?

#### 1.2 For OS

#### Test cases

* Are the data entered passed directly as arguments to a program inside the server?
* Does the application support any function that allows access to a terminal?

### 2 - Broken Authentication

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.

### 3 - Sensitive Data Exposure

Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

### 4 - XML External Entities (XXE)

Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.

### 5 - Broken Access Control

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.

### 6 - Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

### 7 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

### 8 - Insecure Deserialization

Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.

### 9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

### 10 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring.
